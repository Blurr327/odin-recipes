        <li>3 tbsp vegetable or olive oil</li>
        <li>several soup bones (optional)</li>
        <li>2 lbs soft, ripe tomatoes - (about 6 large)</li>
        <li>1 handful dry chickpeas, soaked and peeled</li>
        <li>2 handfuls dry green or brown lentils</li>
        <li>1 large onion, grated</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery (with leaves), chopped</li>
        <li>1 small bunch flat leaf parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 small bunch cilantro, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp smen (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ginger</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon - optional; see notes</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>3 tbsp tomato paste - combined with 1 or 2 cups water</li>
        <li>3 tbsp uncooked rice OR broken vermicelli</li>
        <li>1 cup flour - combined with 2 cups water</li>
        <li>lemon wedges and cilantro (optional) - for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps : </h3>    
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the chickpeas overnight. The next day, drain and peel them. This is easily done by pressing chickpeas one-by-one between your forefinger and thumb or by rubbing all of the chickpeas vigorously in a kitchen towel. (The prepped chickpeas may be be frozen until needed.)</li>
        <li>Pick through the lentils to remove any stones and debris; set aside until ready to use.</li> 
<li>Stew the tomatoes then pass them through a food mill to make a puree; discard the skins and seeds. Or, cut the tomatoes into quarters and process them, with or without skin, in a food processor until smooth. (The pureed tomatoes may be frozen until needed.)</li>
<li>Grate the onion or process it to a thick pulp in a food processor. (The grated onion may be mixed with the pureed tomatoes and frozen until needed.)</li>
<li>Wash the celery and finely chop it. Set aside. Remove and discard large pieces of stem from the parsley and cilantro. Wash the parsley and cilantro and leave to drain thoroughly before chopping finely by hand or in a food processor. (The chopped herbs may be mixed together and frozen until needed.)</li>
    </ol>
