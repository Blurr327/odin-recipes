    <h3>Description : </h3><br>
    <p>
        Chicken bastilla is Morocco's famous chicken pie. A light, crispy warqa pastry shell conceals savory saffron chicken, spicy omelet stuffing, and a crunchy topping of fried almonds sweetened with orange flower water. A garnish of powdered sugar and cinnamon adds to the unique blend of flavors.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (5-pound) chicken</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 large sweet onions, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground white pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon crumbled saffron threads</li>
        <li>2 to 3 sticks cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps : </h3>   
    <ol>
<li>Generously oil a 14-inch or larger round pan. If you don't have a round pan, work on an oiled flat baking sheet or large plate, and shape a circular pie as best you can.</li>
<li>Brush melted butter on each sheet of warqa or phyllo dough as you work. If using phyllo, take care to keep it covered with plastic since it dries out very quickly.</li>
<li>Using your pan as a guide, overlap 3 or 4 single layers of warqa (shiny side down)—or double layers of phyllo dough—in a circular fashion, so that the inner halves of the pastry dough overlap in the center, and the excess dough drapes over the edges of the pan. Butter each layer of dough.</li>
<li>Place one buttered 12-inch circle of warqa, or two 12-inch buttered circles of phyllo, in the center of the pan. This forms the bottom of the pie.</li>
<li>Cover the 12-inch circle with the chicken filling, and distribute the egg stuffing over the chicken.</li>
<li>Top the egg stuffing with another buttered 12-inch circle of warqa (shiny side up), or two 12-inch buttered circles of phyllo. Spread the almond topping over this layer of dough.</li>
<li>Fold the excess dough up and over the almonds to enclose the pie. Flatten and smooth any bulky areas.</li>
<li>Brush butter on the folded edges of dough, and top with 3 more overlapping layers of warqa (shiny side up) or phyllo, brushing butter on each layer. Fold down the edges of dough and carefully tuck them underneath the pie, molding and shaping the bastilla as you go.</li>
<li>Use your hands to spread the egg yolk over the top and sides of the pie. Lightly oil the bastilla in the same manner.</li>
<li>The bastilla is now ready for baking, or it can be covered in plastic and stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 day, or in the freezer for up to 2 months.</li>
